        <strong>I hate music streaming services.</strong>
        <br><br>

        I hate that I don't have the physical copies of the songs and albums that I listen to. I enjoyed when DVDs and vinyls were the norm where the scratches and imperfections told as much a story as the music contained within them. Yet, I see the convenience and reliability of digital music.
        <br><br>

        
        Music that won't wear down with age. That sounds as if the artist just recorded it and put it to a physical medium, but even in this case I'm a special case.
        <br><br>

        
         I like to modify tags and album covers and use music files in scripts and other programs. This usually ends up with me deleting Metadata and it would be helpful if there was tool to to allieviate my unique problem.  
         <br><br>

        
        This is why I created <a href="https://github.com/Jasper-Hawks/MetaMusic">MetaMusic</a>. <a href="https://github.com/Jasper-Hawks/MetaMusic">MetaMusic</a> is a Python3 script that applies metadata to files using an unofficial Youtube Music API.  It can apply metadata to entire albums or single files and accepts stdin. 
        <br><br>

        
        <strong><a href="https://github.com/Jasper-Hawks/MetaMusic">MetaMusic</a> is a script-friendly metadata tag editor that is simple, extensible, and fast.</strong>
        <br><br>

        
        <a href="https://github.com/Jasper-Hawks/MetaMusic">MetaMusic</a> does this by searching Youtube Music for the name of the file or the name of the directory, finding the song or album, then applying the data to the file(s). It does all of this within seconds even for the largest of albums all while outputting status codes so you know what songs have had data applied and which have not.
        <br><br>

        
        <a href="https://github.com/Jasper-Hawks/MetaMusic">MetaMusic</a> also has a myriad of flags in order to help the user find the music they would like to tag. Using the help flag you can see all the helpful flags that <a href="https://github.com/Jasper-Hawks/MetaMusic">MetaMusic</a> comes packaged with. All while adhering to the Unix Philosiphy of doing one thing and doing that thing well.
        <br><br>

        
        If you think you can find some use out of <a href="https://github.com/Jasper-Hawks/MetaMusic">MetaMusic</a> consider downloading it from <a href="https://github.com/Jasper-Hawks/MetaMusic">Github</a> and trying it.
