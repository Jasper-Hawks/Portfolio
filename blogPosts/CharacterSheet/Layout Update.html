        It's been a while since I've updated this blog.
        <br><br>
        A Lot has happened since I started working on The Pathfinder Character Sheet,but I can confidently say that half of the layout work for the sheet is
        completed. There is a lot of work that still has to be done in order for the site
        to look like the <a href="https://pathfindercharactersheets.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/147324275-Editable-Pathfinder-Character-Sheet.pdf">PDF</a>.
        <br><br>

        During this time I've been working strictly on the layout. The only thing
        challenging me was boredom as there was no other way to create all the various
        input fields and labels without manual labor.
        <br><br>

        Styling was simple and easy as most input fields and labels share similar styling. Scaling elements as the viewport changed was a minor challenge but
        taught me about display properties, when to format elements vertically vs
        horizontally, and the usefulness of containers.
        <br><br>

        Overall, I've had fun working on this project. There have been points where
        I've wanted to scrap the entire thing and start on something that won't have me
        copying and pasting hundreds of input fields, but, I'm proud of what I've created so far.
