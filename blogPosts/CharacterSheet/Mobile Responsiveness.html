        The majority of the sites that I've created have used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/css_units.asp">relative units</a>
        in order for the site to function well on mobile and desktop
        browsers. You can view these units in effect if you are on a mobile device, or if
        you simulate it on your desktop.
        <br><br>
        The point of all of this is to say that these relative units scale RELATIVE to
        a specific element of the browser. Whether it's how wide the viewport is in the
        case of VWs or the length of a certain character (EM). The majority of websites
        use these in order to scale their websites up and down depending on the size of
        the screen that you are viewing the site on. Older websites who were made when
        these units did not exist will just display the site as you would see it on a
        desktop.
        <br><br>
        The text is usually small and links and buttons are usually skewed or appear out of
        the oridnary. This effect is undesired because on mobile devices smaller text and 
        elements can cause the user to misclick and strain their eyes. As such relative units
        are used when the screen gets small enough.
        <br><br>
        But what if you would like to have this effect?
        <br><br>
        This was the case with The Pathfinder Character Sheet that I am developing. Since this
        website is a recreation of The Official Character Sheet used by Paizo in digital form
        why would we scale elements to increase text and element size. If you were viewing a
        PDF on your phone you would zoom in and pan around, so why not have the same behavior
        on the site.
        <br><br>
        After the screen becomes small enough the width and height of the site are set staticly
        , and you can navigate the site the same way you would read a document. This allows the 
        site not to be constrained by relative units scaling to the smallest of screens. It also
        increases readability as scaling down to screens that small would have text and other
        elements scale down to the point of having the user zoom in any way. This way I as a developer
        can do less work and so can the user.
        <br><br>
        You can see an example of this behavior<a href="https://pfcharactersheet.netlify.app/">here</a> 
        <br><br>
        As you resize the screen eventually the width and height become static and you
        can pan around the site with the scrollbar.
