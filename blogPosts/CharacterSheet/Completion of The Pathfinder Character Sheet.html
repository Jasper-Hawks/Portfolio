    <a href="https://upfcharactersheet.netlify.app/">Jasper's Unofficial Pathfinder Character Sheet</a> is now completed. Here are some of my reflections after working on this project for 8 months.<br><br>


    After those 8 long months I dread looking at the sites source like anyone would after working on something that took longer than expected. If you've seen the site I'm sure you can guess where most of the time went. The skill section alone took me a month and half just to regain the mental fortitude I lost with each row, but this isn't about my deteriorating mental state this is about the sheet.
    <br><br>
    
    With this character sheet I wanted to focus on efficiency, simplicity, and reliability. I've seen many other character sheets for Pathfinder who automate the entire process of character creation. The user picks from a handful of drop-downs and the character poofs into existence. I've never liked this way of creating characters as it took the experience of making a character and turned it into more of completing a Google Form. 
    <br><br>
    
    <strong>I wanted the simplicity and intimacy of a paper sheet with the convenience and portability of a digital interface.</strong>
    <br><br>
    
    I've succeeded on both fronts, though there are some functions on the sheet that stand to improve. The spells section is the most glaring problem of the sheet with no clear solution. Characters can have access to tens of hundreds of spells that they can prepare and cast at any time and the current giant text box of spells is a bandage solution to a problem that I'll have to revisit in the coming months.
    <br><br>
    
    Other than those improvements in functionality the site is well written, fast, and reliable. With just pure CSS HTML and minimal JS the site loads fast, is incredibly responsive and will allow you to import/export characters anywhere at any time. 
    <br><br>
    
    There are some bugs that have still slipped through the cracks. For example, when an entry that has a modal is removed from an imported file a TypeError will be thrown. I've been mulling over opening a <a href="https://github.com/Jasper-Hawks/UnofficialPathfinderCharacterSheet">Github</a> issue about it but I'm sure I'll see something that doesn't look right once I revisit this project. 
    <br><br>
    
    For now, enjoy the sheet, feel free to email me a message if you enjoy it or <a href="https://ko-fi.com/jasperhawks">donate</a> if you feel generous. If you'd like to help or see an issue with the sheet feel free to open a pull request on <a href="https://github.com/Jasper-Hawks/UnofficialPathfinderCharacterSheet">Github</a>.
