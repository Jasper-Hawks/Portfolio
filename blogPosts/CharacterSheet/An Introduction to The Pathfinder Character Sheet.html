        One of my favorite hobbies is playing Tabletop Role-playing Games with friends, more specifically Dungeons and Dragons. I've been running games of Dungeons and Dragons for friends and colleagues for over six years, and in that time I have always wanted to explore different Tabletop Role-playing Game systems, but, none of these systems have the seniority and the vast amount of helpful resources like Dungeons and Dragons. So I thought that I could try my hand at creating one of Dungeons and Dragons most popular tools for an entirely different system that I have been interested in for years, Pathfinder.

    <p>If you've never played a Tabletop Role-playing Game before, a group of people bring characters that they've made to a Game Master who tells a story that their characters get to interact with. You can think of it like an improvisational play, where the Game Master tells and facilitates the story and the characters are actors acting out their characters as the narrative progresses.<br><br>

        One of the most important things to the entire game is a character sheet. This is a sheet that details everything about your character, including what they do, what they look like etc. I'll be building one of these sheets that streamlines the process by putting it on a site where you can import and export different characters for different games.
