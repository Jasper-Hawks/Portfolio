    <p>A friend and I were talking one morning about plans after high school, and during the conversation, they spoke about how they would like to find an apartment to call home. However, searching and compiling the data on different complexes proved tiring and time-consuming. So, like any friend in this situation, I offered to help streamline the process by creating an entire application from scratch.
<br><br>
        Apartment Scraper scrapes <a href="Apartments.com">Apartments.com</a> for all listings of Apartments within a given region. The data is then printed to a spreadsheet that you can open with your editor of choice. I've already created a prototype that  holds the basic functionality of the entire program and will be expanding upon it to support scraping more data such as amenities, square footage, and ratings. I hope you learn something by following  this application or contributing to its development on GitHub.
