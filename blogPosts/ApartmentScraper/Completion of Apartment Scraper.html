    <p>Apartment Scraper is complete. The issues, features, and more are listed below.<br><br>

        I knew when I created Apartment Scraper that I did not want it to use the same interface as Pysistant. Pysistant uses click commands in order to access different functionalities of the program. This would slow down the entering of data on an already slow program, so I decided against it. I also didn't want to go out of my way to install a different python package in order to handle arguments on the command line, I opted to use argparse as it met both of these criteria.  Argparse takes care of error handling and help messages, consequently leaving customization of arguments to the programmer. This coupled with the groundwork I had laid when testing the initial prototype allowed me to create and parse arguments all within the base package of Python.

        The main problem that slowed the project down was time management. Unexpected events occurred that took me away from the computer and made the project slow to a crawl. Many developers know that once you're out of the state where your mind is eager to code that it can be hard to return to that mindset and that's what happened to me during the projects development.
