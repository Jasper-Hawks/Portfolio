    <p>While I was in high school enrolled in  online classes I always found myself going to
        Brave to search for the definition of a word or using an external application in
        order to keep track of homework assignments or others tasks that needed
        completion. I was also learning Python at the time and thought about creating
        an assistant that could handle all of the problems mentioned prior and more all
        within the terminal window. Using some of my prior experience with Java
        learning Python was less challenging than going in without any experience but
        by the time I was proficient in Python the school year was nearing completion.
        Nevertheless, I still sometimes find myself needlessly spending time within a
        browser or calculator that I could spend within the terminal. Pysistant will allow for simple mundane tasks that are completed in separate applications to be streamlined all within the terminal.
