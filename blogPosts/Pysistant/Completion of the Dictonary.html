    <p>The Dictionary portion of the Pysistant has been completed. The issues, features, and more are listed below.
        </p>

    <h2>Problems and Solutions</h2>
    <p>I have added a Dictionary to Pysistant by using a combination of the <a href="https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/index.html">Requests library</a>,
        <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup 4</a> and Regex to scrape definitions from
        <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a>. <br><br>

        The implementation of a Dictionary proved to be a simple task to program. The majority of the issues I ran into were of my own creation,
        due to the amount of features Beautiful Soup 4 and finding a website that was simple enough to scrape but also had the definitions that I
        wanted. 
        <br><br>
        The amount of features that Beautiful Soup 4 supports had me scraping the documentation for how I should tackle scraping websites for information.
        After a few days of reading the documentation and watching videos on the library itself I learned about the find_all method and how to use a loop
        in order to return the information that I wanted to pull from the site. But I still needed a website in order to put this theory into practice.
        <br><br>
        Finding a website that was simple enough to scrape but also had the definitions that I needed proved to be a difficult and unique challenge. I
        immediately looked towards larger sites like Merriam-Webster and Dictionary.com but their layouts proved to be either too complex or bloated to
        scrape efficiently. I looked further and eventually found WordNet. With it's simple design and even simpler HTML I could finally get to work on
        scraping definitions from the site.
        <br><br>
        And with a bit of Regex I was able to scrape WordNet for definitions to words based on user input. The majority of the challenge for this project
        proved to be outside the IDE and led to a resource who's minimalist design triumphed over their more convoluted counterparts.
