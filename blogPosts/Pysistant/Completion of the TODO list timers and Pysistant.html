    <h2>Problems and Solutions</h2>
    <p>The majority of the problems were mostly formatting oversights such as putting a newline character in an incorrect place. Overall this 
        portion of the project was the easiest out of the <a href="Completion of the Calculator.html">Calculator</a> and 
        <a href="Completion of the Dictonary.html">Dictionary</a><br><br>

        Pysistant proved to be a fun and frustrating project. There were areas such as the TODO list that were challenging where stepping back
        and taking a break always revealed a simple solution to an aggravating problem. This was a great way of combining my knowledge of python
        fundamentals and libraries into a project that I will use everyday. You can check out the repository <a href="https://github.com/Jasper-Hawks/Pysistant">here</a>.
